INTRODUCTION
-------------
PDesireAudio is a kernel driver by Tristan Marsell and Team DevElite, based on WCD drivers by Qualcomm.
Two modes are included:

	PDesireAudio Ultra High Quality Mode:
	Forked from the WCD9xxx Ultra High Quality Mode but more advanced
	Main Features:
		-disable every possible CSLH stream to save more power
		-enable CLSAB streams to minimize distortion on high and low frequencies
		-disable all compander streams (COMP0, COMP1, etc.) to reduce distortion
		-disable all decimator streams (DEC0, DEC1, etc.) to disable cut-offs on audio
		-Set Ultra High Quality Audio mode on even when frequency is not 192kHz 24bit
		-Microphone dynamic High Pass Filter bypass
		-little bit power saving due less streams
		-Set default amperages higher on SPKDRV


	PDesireAudio Advanced Mode:
	Works in combination with PDesireAudio Ultra High Quality Mode
	Main Features:
		-reset compander streams
